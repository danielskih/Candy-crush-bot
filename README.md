# Candy crush game bot

### All the work is in Jupiter Notebooks. 

Bot v1 is almost blind, it relays on input for dimensions and moves by numerical increments.
Bot v2 is work in progress to make it see the candies so we can add some intelligence.
Bot v4 is the latest. It basically functions but still has some logical faults.
Bot v5 is same as 4 but with all cells merged in two large cells: first with definitions and global variables and second with the bot looping over the screen so it is easier to run.
The playing area go the game has to matched with a lower left corner of the monitor, run the first cell of the notebook, the program will prompt user for the input of the dimensions of the game board: just couunt the tiles in the widest section of the game board.

Create the environment from the environment.yml file; conda env create -f environment. yml

Collaborators are highly welcome :)
