# Candy crush game bot

## Specifically Candy crush game bot.

### All the work is in Jupiter Notebooks. 

Bot v1 is almost blind, it relays on input for dimensions and moves by numerical increments.
Bot v2 is work in progress to make it see the candies so we can add some intelligence.
Bot v4 is the latest. It basically functions. Still has some bugs.
Bot v5 is same as 4 but with all cells merged in 2; one with definitions and globals vars. And second with the bot looping over the screen.
The playing area go the game has to matched with a lower left corner of the monitor. The program will prompt user for the input of the game board in tiles.

Create the environment from the environment.yml file;	conda env create -f environment. yml

Collaborators are highly welcome :)
