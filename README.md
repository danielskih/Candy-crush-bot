# Candy crush game bot

Create the environment from the environment.yml file:	conda env create -f environment. yml. 

Bot v1 is almost blind, it relays on input for dimensions and moves by numerical increments.
Bot v2 is WIP to make it see the candies so we can add some intelligence.

Bot 3 has logic for operating the game.
